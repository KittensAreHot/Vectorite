# Vectorite

## Description
This is a simple program made in javascript with p5.js.
It visualizes vector fields by spreading a bunch of particles that use their position and the given vector field to calculate their velocity.
This produces a pretty visualization of some function like those commented in the function ```vectorField(x, y)```.

## Ideas for new featrures
 - [ ] Add a button to randomize the vector field
 - [ ] Freezing the screen.
 - [ ] Panning.
 - [ ] Zooming.
 - [ ] Allow for different effects when holding/dragging left mouse button(currently only spawning particles with higher "death time").
 - [ ] Popup menu that allow manupulation of what is seen on screen. 
 - [ ] Applying the function dynamically(A part of the popup menu).
