## Description
This is a simple program made in javascript with the library p5.js.
It visualizes a vector field by spreading a bunch of particles that use their position and the given vector field to calculate their velocity.
Thus, producing a pretty visualizing of some function like those commented in the function ```vectorField(x, y)```.

## Ideas for new featrures
[ ] Freezing the screen.
[ ] Panning.
[ ] Zooming.
[ ] Allow for different effects when holding/dragging left mouse button(currently only spawning particles with higher "death time").
[ ] Popup menu that allow manupulation of what is seen on screen. 
[ ] Applying the function dynamically(A part of the popup menu).
